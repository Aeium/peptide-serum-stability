# PeptideSerumStability
Serum stability studies can provide insight the ability of a peptide to resist serum degradation. These studies involve incubating a peptide in mouse serum and periodically checking for peptide fragments using mass spectrometry data. This set of tools will allow determination of peptide fragments given mass spec data.
